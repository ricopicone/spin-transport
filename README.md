## spin-transport README

This repository contains the (developing) open-source code for simulating bulk spin transport&mdash;diffusion and separation&mdash;in solid media. Multi-spin-species and magnetic resonance simulations are in development.

This is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) project. FEniCS is used to numerically solve the spin transport governing partial differential equations.

End users of this project write Python code to interface with FEniCS.

### Installation

One must first have a working installation of FEniCS.
This README assumes the use of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for installation, which is documented [here](http://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/).

Install `fenicsproject` command with the following command.

```console
curl -s https://get.fenicsproject.org | bash
```

Then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this repository to the host machine.

### Workflow

text

```console
fenicsproject run stable python3 <python script> <options>
```

explain

The FEniCS docs have a section on [workflow](http://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/work_flows.html).
There are many ways to instantiate these good practices, but if you're using a \*nix system, the following may be the easiest.

With the cloned `spin-transport` repository as your working directory, create a link in your path to **spin-transport**'s `fenics` executable bash script.


```shell
ln fenics /usr/local/bin
```

Now a FEniCS Python script `foo.py` can be started with the command `fenics foo.py` **from the host** instead of manually starting it from a Docker container.
This has several advantages, including that there is no need to move scripts into the container and that the complicated syntax need not be remembered.

### Testing the installation

To verify that everything is installed correctly, run the Poisson equation demo `ft01_poisson.py` ([source](https://fenicsproject.org/pub/tutorial/html/._ftut1004.html)) in your container.

If you installed the `fenics` bash script per the instructions above, you can use the following command (working directory: `spin-transport`).


```shell
$ fenics ft01_poisson.py
```

If everything is working fine, the output should look something like the following.


```shell
$ fenics ft01_poisson.py

error_max = 1.33226762955e-15
```

The directory `spin-transport/poisson` should have been created and should contain two files: `solution.pvd` and `solution000000.vtu`.
These files contain the solution data.
